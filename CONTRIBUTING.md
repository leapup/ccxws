## Adding Exchanges

The following tips are useful when implementing exchanges:

### Clients

- Add client and the corresponding integration test file to `src/exchanges` folder
- Client that support multiple market subscriptions on the same websocket should implement `base-client.js`, refer to `hitbtc-client.js`, `zb-client.js`, etc for some examples.
- `base-client.js` implements the correct external interface for CCXWS, reconnection logic, and dead connection logic for a single connection. This largely takes the heavy lifting of implementing an exchange out of your hands for exchanges that implement a decent multi-market per socket API.
- Some exchange only support a single market per socket. You can implement `basic-multiclient.js` which uses `basic-client.js` under the covers. `basic-multi-client.js` creates a new `basic-client.js` implementation for each market that is connected to it. Refer to `coinex-client.js` or `cex-client.js`.
- The subscribe methods (`subscribeTrades`, `subscribeTicker`, etc) take a single market as the argument. The client should expect that a subscribe method will be called with many markets in quick succession. Some exchanges will drop the connection if too many messages are sent in quick succession. You can use a semaphore to throttle the sending of messages. Refer to `hitbtc-client.js`, `okex-client.js` as examples of implementing semaphore. Be sure to clear out semaphores on connection events!

### Order Books

- Order books can be level 1 (top bid/ask), level 2 (volume aggregated by price), or level 3 (raw orders)
- Order books APIs may be snapshots (full order book), updates (changes since last update), or a may allow both snapshots and updates
- Depth APIs are aggregates of order books at set price intervals (0, 0.1, 0.01, etc). A depth API at the smallest granularity is indistinguishable from a raw level 2 order book
- Order book updates always need to start with an order book snapshot request. This makes order book maintenance simpler by broadcasting a snapshot event at the start of the update event stream.
- Some exchanges do not support querying the order book snapshot via the WebSocket API, in that rare case, we will execute a REST query for the orderbook snapshot.

### Numerics vs Strings

CCXWS returns all numeric types as strings, with the exception of the unix timestamp. For reference, refer to the API documentation for [Ticker](https://github.com/altangent/ccxws#ticker), [Trade](https://github.com/altangent/ccxws#ticker), [Level2Point](https://github.com/altangent/ccxws#level2point), and [Level3Point](https://github.com/altangent/ccxws#level3point).

Numeric values are returned as strings to prevent data loss. JavaScript Numeric type is stored as an IEEE 754 floating point value. The maximum number of signicant digits is 15, meaning that large integers and floating point values will result in precision loss.

Many exchanges return API results with numeric values as strings already. In the event that an exchange does not return values as strings, you can take two options:

1. Convert numerics to strings with `.toFixed(8)`
2. Preprocess the raw message string and wrap numerics with double quotes prior to running `JSON.parse`

The former method is preferred if an exchange does not return values that overflow (refer to the number of digits being sent). The latter is required when data would overflow due to the exchange sending large numeric types.

Lastly, when adding an exchange's unit tests, ensure that you perform type assertions to guarantee that results are returned as strings.

## Testing

Add a test file to `__tests__` for the client using the standard spec template.

You can run tests for an individual exchange with:

```bash
$(npm bin)/mocha __tests__/exchanges/hitbtc-client.spec.js
```

### Additional testing

It is often useful to create a `test.js` file (which is excluded from git) in the root of the application and directly exercise your code outside of unit tests
code. For example:

```javascript
let ccxws = require("./src");

// HitBTC
let market1 = { id: "BTCUSD", base: "BTC", quote: "USDT" };
let market2 = { id: "ETHBTC", base: "ETH", quote: "BTC" };
let client = new ccxws.hitbtc();

//////////////////////////////////

client.subscribeTicker(market);
client.on("ticker", console.log);

// client.subscribeTrades(market);
// client.on("trade", t => console.log(t));

// client.subscribeLevel2Snapshots(market);
// client.on("l2snapshot", console.log);

// client.subscribeLevel2Updates(market);
// client.on("l2update", console.log);
```
